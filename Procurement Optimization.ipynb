    "Objective : The objective of the optimization is to find allocate volumes to different freight suppliers to **optimize the overall costs** associated taking into consideration capacity, lead time for the service and minimum business for each suppliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data\n",
    "There are 4 datasets used in the optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "- The rates for each lane (fore each supplier)\n",
    "- The LT for each lane for each suppliers\n",
    "- The company budgeted volumes for each lane\n",
    "- Capacity for each supplier in each lane (This information is used to draw different scenarios in the analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions to answer here are to draw different baseline numbers for optimal decision making:\n",
    "- **1. What is the cost associated with not going for a tender and all earlier price remain the same**\n",
    "- **2. What is the most minimum cost that we can achieve by taking the lowest cost supplier**\n",
    "- **3. Cost of lead time inefficiencies**\n",
    "- **4. Since we know some of the supplier are very strong in certain areas we only give the lanes to them what is the costs once this is done (This is done by making the capacity of other suppliers 0)**\n",
    "- **5. We need to provide certain suppliers with a certain amount of business so that they come back for the bids next time and the prices stay competitive - so here we put in minimum value constraint for each supplier**"
